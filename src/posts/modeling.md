# 1. UXEcon 2020 Break 
<p class="date">Summer 2020</p>

During my internship at Google, I had the opportunity to make the break screen for the virtual 2-day annual conference for all UX Engineers (and friends) at Google. The style guide for all conference materials was inspired by Bauhaus textiles work.

I produced a 30 minute video, counting down from 30 minutes to 0 minutes.

The animation was made with Maya 2019, and rendered with Arnold Renderer.
