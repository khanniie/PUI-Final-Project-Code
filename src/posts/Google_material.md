# Primary Project

My intern project involved working in a team with a designer, Michelle Alvarez and a researcher, Dawn Shaikh, to create a prototype that we used in a user study to 
compare various VF onboarding materials that educate users about the general benefits of VFs, the nature of VFs, and the registered/unregistered axes available in given typeface. 
The study learnings will guide the design of both a material.io experience and the initial onboarding experience on Google Fonts.

# Secondary Project
For my secondary project, I worked with Clayton Meador and Dave Crossland to deploy a microsite with interactive creative demos for variable fonts. 
I was given an incredible amount of agency for this project. The visual design and concepts are my own,
aided by the feedback by the many amazing designers on Material Design like Michelle Alvarez and Sharon Harris.
The site is currently live at [googlefonts.github.io/fluid](googlefonts.github.io/fluid).
