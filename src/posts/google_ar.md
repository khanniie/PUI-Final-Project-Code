# Project

In Summer and Fall 2020, I was a UX Engineering intern on Google's AR team (formerly known as Daydream). Although the nature of the project is still confidential, I can still talk generally about some of the skills that I used and the lessons that I learned. If you'd like to learn more, please reach out :-). If you're a Google employee, I can put you in touch with my intern host who may be able to provide more information.

Towards the end of my summer internship, my team extended my internship through a small program at Google that allows interns to continue working part-time while in university. So during the Fall semester of my senior year, I worked part-time (20% for a month, and then 50% for two months).

This was my first time working in a product-focused team. As part of the UX team, I worked closely with the other members of the UX team, but also interacted with PMs and software engineers.
